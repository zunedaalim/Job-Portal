The Job Portal is a web app built with the MERN Stack that makes the job application process easier.
Users can choose their role (applicant or recruiter) and create an account. Once logged in, sessions stay active, and REST APIs are secured using JWT tokens. Recruiters can post, update, or delete jobs, manage applications (shortlist, accept, or reject), view resumes, and update their profile. Applicants can search for jobs with filters, apply with a Statement of Purpose (SOP), track their applications, upload a profile picture and resume, and update their profile. It's a complete solution for managing job applications.
